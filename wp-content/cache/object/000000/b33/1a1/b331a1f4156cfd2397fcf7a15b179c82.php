TheÂ pebble-bed reactorÂ (PBR) is a graphite-moderated, gas-cooledÂ nuclear reactor. It is a type ofÂ very-high-temperature reactorÂ (VHTR), one of the six classes of nuclear reactors in theÂ Generation IV initiative. The basic design of pebble-bed reactors features spherical fuel elements called pebbles. These tennis ball-sized pebbles are made ofÂ pyrolytic graphiteÂ (which acts as the moderator), and they contain thousands of micro-fuel particles calledÂ TRISOÂ particles. These TRISO fuel particles consist of a fissile material (such asÂ 235U) surrounded by a coated ceramic layer ofÂ silicon carbideÂ for structural integrity and fission product containment. In the PBR, thousands of pebbles are amassed to create aÂ reactor core, and are cooled by a gas, such asÂ helium,Â nitrogenÂ orÂ carbon dioxide, that does not react chemically with the fuel elements.

This type of reactor is claimed to be passively safe;[1]Â that is, it removes the need for redundant, active safety systems. Because the reactor is designed to handle high temperatures, it can cool by natural circulation and still survive in accident scenarios, which may raise the temperature of the reactor to 1,600Â Â°C. Because of its design, its high temperatures allow higher thermal efficiencies than possible in traditionalÂ nuclear power plantsÂ (up to 50%) and has the additional feature that the gases do not dissolve contaminants or absorb neutrons as water does, so the core has less in the way of radioactiveÂ fluids.

The concept was first suggested byÂ Farrington DanielsÂ in the 1940s, said to have been inspired by the innovative design of the benghazi burnerÂ by British desert troops in WWII, but commercial development did not take place until the 1960s in the GermanÂ AVR reactorÂ byÂ Rudolf Schulten.[2]Â but this system was plagued with problems and political and economic decisions were made to abandon the technology.[3]Â The AVR design was licensed toÂ South AfricaÂ as theÂ PBMRÂ andÂ ChinaÂ as theÂ HTR-10, the latter currently the only such design operational. In various forms, other designs are under development byÂ MIT,University of California at Berkeley,Â General AtomicsÂ (U.S.), theÂ DutchÂ company Romawa B.V.,Â Adams Atomic Engines, and Idaho National Laboratory.
